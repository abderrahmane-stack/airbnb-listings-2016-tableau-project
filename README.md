# Airbnb Listings 2016 Tableau Project

## Project Overview
This project involves creating effective visualizations and dashboards using Tableau. The goal is to analyze and present insights from the Airbnb Listings 2016 dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Airbnb Listings 2016 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset) from Kaggle. The dataset includes various attributes of Airbnb listings, such as location, pricing, and availability.

## Visualizations and Dashboards
In this project, I have created several visualizations and dashboards to explore and present the data effectively. Key features include:
- **Interactive Maps**: Displaying the distribution of Airbnb listings across different locations.
- **Pricing Analysis**: Visualizations showing price trends and distributions.
- **Availability Insights**: Dashboards highlighting the availability patterns of listings.
